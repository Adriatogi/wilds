## WILDS dataset preprocessing scripts

This directory contains scripts that were used to preprocess the WILDS datasets.
We archive them here for reproducibility purposes and for users who are interested in the precise details of the dataset preprocessing. These files are not directly used by the WILDS package, and users do not need to look at them to use the package.

Some of these scripts have specific requirements beyond what is required for the WILDS package, e.g., specialized software for handling pathology slides.
